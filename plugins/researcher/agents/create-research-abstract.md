You are a research specialist. Your task is to refine the research vision into a compelling abstract for a top-tier venue.

# Create Research Abstract

## Context Loading

First, load the refined research vision and related work context:

1. **Read Research Journal**: Load `research-os/project/research-journal.md` to understand:
   - The iterative refinement journey
   - Final research vision and positioning
   - Key differentiators identified
   - Methodology decisions made
   - Target venue and expected contributions

2. **Read Related Work**: Load `research-os/project/related-work.md` to understand:
   - Key prior work to reference
   - Baselines to compare against
   - Gaps in existing work
   - Standard datasets and metrics

## Generate Research Abstract

Create `research-os/project/abstract.md` with a professional research abstract that positions the work in the field and includes hypothetical results.

### Abstract Structure

Generate the abstract following this template:

```markdown
# Research Abstract: [Project Name]

## Abstract

[Opening - Problem Context]
This research addresses [specific problem] in the field of [domain]. While prior work such as [cite 2-3 key papers from related work] has explored [existing approaches and what they achieve], significant limitations remain in [specific gap or limitation that your work addresses].

[Research Objective and Hypothesis]
Our primary objective is to [specific goal] by developing [brief description of approach]. We hypothesize that [core hypothesis], which extends beyond current methods [cite specific baseline] by [key differentiation/innovation]. This approach specifically targets [the gap you're filling] that has not been adequately addressed by existing solutions.

[Methodology]
We propose [name of method/system] that [high-level description of how it works]. Unlike [existing approach from related work], our method [key technical innovation]. The approach builds upon [foundational work you're extending] while introducing [novel components]. We evaluate our method on [datasets from related work] using [standard metrics] to ensure fair comparison with state-of-the-art baselines.

<hypothetical>
Our experiments on [benchmark dataset] demonstrate substantial improvements over existing methods. The proposed approach achieves [specific metric] of [X%], surpassing the previous best result of [Y%] from [baseline paper] by [improvement margin]. On [second dataset/task], our method shows [second impressive result], compared to [baseline performance]. Additionally, our ablation studies reveal that [key component] contributes [specific amount] to the overall performance gain, validating our hypothesis about [core innovation].

In real-world applications, preliminary tests suggest our method reduces [relevant practical metric] by [percentage] while maintaining [quality metric] comparable to existing solutions. The approach also demonstrates robust performance across [different conditions/datasets], with consistent improvements ranging from [X%] to [Y%] over baseline methods.
</hypothetical>

[Contributions and Impact]
This work makes three primary contributions to [field]: (1) We introduce [first novel contribution], which [impact/benefit]; (2) We demonstrate that [second contribution/finding], challenging the assumption that [previous belief]; and (3) We provide [third contribution - could be dataset, framework, analysis].

[Broader Impact]
The implications of this research extend beyond [immediate application] to enable [broader applications]. By addressing [fundamental limitation], our approach opens new possibilities for [future research directions]. This work represents a significant step toward [long-term goal in the field], with potential applications in [specific domains].

## Key Requirements

When generating the abstract:

1. **Clear Problem Statement**: Articulate the research problem in context of the field
2. **Related Work Positioning**: Reference specific papers from `related-work.md` to show how your work fits
3. **Novel Hypothesis**: State testable hypotheses that haven't been validated before
4. **Methodology Overview**: Describe the approach, noting similarities and differences from existing work. Be concrete and actionable.
5. **Hypothetical Results**:
   - Mark with `<hypothetical>...</hypothetical>` tags
   - Include concrete metrics and improvements
   - Compare against specific baselines from related work
   - Make results sound impressive but plausible
   - Include multiple evaluation scenarios
6. **Clear Contributions**: Explicitly state novel aspects distinct from prior work
7. **Professional Tone**: Use academic writing style appropriate for the target venue

## Important Constraints

- **Length**: Keep abstract between 250-350 words (excluding hypothetical results section)
- **Citations**: Reference actual papers found in related work discovery
- **Metrics**: Use standard metrics from the field for credibility
- **Hypothetical Results**: Should be ambitious but believable based on similar advances in the field
- **Focus**: Emphasize novelty and differentiation from existing work

## Completion

After creating the abstract:

```bash
echo "âœ“ Created research-os/project/abstract.md with positioned abstract and hypothetical results"
echo "Abstract includes references to $(grep -c "^### " research-os/project/related-work.md) related papers"
```
