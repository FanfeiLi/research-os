You are a research specialist. Your task is to take the research vision, related work and abstract to draft a research roadmap that supports all the major claims and fairly compares against existing work.

# Create Research Roadmap

## Context Loading

Before creating the roadmap, understand the research context:

1. **Read Research Journal**: Load `research-os/project/research-journal.md` to understand:
   - Final research vision and methodology
   - Technical approach decisions
   - Expected contributions and scope

2. **Read Related Work**: Load `research-os/project/related-work.md` to identify:
   - Baseline methods to reproduce
   - Standard evaluation protocols
   - Datasets and benchmarks to use
   - Existing implementations to reference

3. **Read Abstract**: Load `research-os/project/abstract.md` to understand:
   - Hypothetical results to work toward
   - Key claims that need validation
   - Promised contributions to deliver

## Generate Experiment Roadmap

Create `research-os/project/roadmap.md` with a dependency-based experiment plan.

### Critical Requirement: Minimum Triage Experiment

**ALWAYS start with a minimum triage experiment** that validates core hypothesis viability with minimal investment (1-2 days maximum).

### Roadmap Structure

Generate the roadmap following this template:

# Research Experiment Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the experimental plan for validating [research hypothesis] and achieving the results outlined in our abstract. The experiments are organized by dependencies, with each phase building on validated results from previous phases.

## Phase 0: Minimum Triage Experiment (Days 1-2)
**CRITICAL: This experiment determines go/no-go for the entire research project**

### Experiment 0.1: Core Hypothesis Validation
- **Objective**: Quickly test if [core assumption/mechanism] shows any promise
- **Duration**: 1-2 days maximum
- **Approach**:
  - Implement minimal version of [key innovation]
  - Test on small subset of [dataset] (e.g., 100 examples)
  - Compare against naive baseline (not full baseline)
- **Required Resources**:
  - Basic dataset sample (can use subset of [standard dataset])
  - Minimal compute (CPU or single GPU for few hours)
- **Baseline Comparison**:
  - Naive baseline: [simple approach, e.g., random, majority class]
  - Quick implementation of core idea
  - Check if improvement > [X%] over naive baseline
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Core mechanism produces non-random results
  - [ ] Shows [X%] improvement over naive baseline
  - [ ] Computation completes in reasonable time
  - [ ] No fundamental blockers discovered
- **Decision Gate**:
  - **GO**: If improvement is >= [X%] and mechanism works as expected
  - **PIVOT**: If mechanism works but needs adjustment
  - **NO-GO**: If fundamental assumption is invalid or no improvement

- **Clear decision gates**: Explicit success criteria and go/no-go decisions

## Completion

After creating the roadmap:

```bash
echo "✓ Created research-os/project/roadmap.md with dependency-based experiment plan"
echo "Roadmap contains $(grep -c "^### Experiment" research-os/project/roadmap.md) experiments across $(grep -c "^## Phase" research-os/project/roadmap.md) phases"
echo "Minimum triage experiment defined for go/no-go decision"
```
